Response: 
This code is decent. However, there are some security vulnerabilities and suggestions for improvement that can be made to improve the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of the code. Here's a review of the code:

Security Vulnerabilities:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. However, the `f-string` in the query is not properly sanitized. A malicious user could potentially inject SQL code into the `username` and `password` parameters to bypass the login mechanism. To fix this, use the `sqlite3.paramstyle` parameter style instead of using `f-strings`.
2. Password Storage: The code stores the password in plaintext. This is not secure because if the database is compromised, the attacker can access all passwords. Instead, it's recommended to store the password as a hashed value using a secure hashing function such as bcrypt or argon2.
3. Weak Password Storage: The code uses MD5 for hashing passwords, which is not secure because it's a fast and weak algorithm. It's recommended to use a stronger algorithm such as bcrypt or argon2 for password storage.
4. Insecure Randomness: The code doesn't have any security measures in place to prevent predictable behavior when generating random numbers. It's recommended to use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) to generate the salt and password hash values.

Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Use `sqlite3.paramstyle` for parameterized queries instead of `f-strings`. This will prevent SQL injection attacks and make the code more secure.
2. Store passwords using a secure hashing function such as bcrypt or argon2. This will improve the security of the password storage mechanism and prevent plaintext passwords from being stored in the database.
3. Use a stronger algorithm for password hashing than MD5. MD5 is fast and weak, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks and other types of attacks. Instead, use a slower and more secure algorithm such as bcrypt or argon2.
4. Use a CSPRNG for generating random numbers instead of using the built-in `random` module. This will improve the security of the randomness generation mechanism and prevent predictable behavior when generating random numbers.
5. Consider adding a layer of encryption to the password storage mechanism. While hashing is sufficient for most use cases, it's still possible for an attacker to crack the hashed password using brute force attacks or other methods. Encrypting the password with a strong algorithm such as AES-256 will provide an additional layer of security and make it more difficult for an attacker to access the password.
6. Add input validation for the username and password parameters. It's important to validate user input to prevent malicious users from injecting SQL code or other types of attacks. Use a whitelist of allowed characters for the username and password parameters, and validate that they are not empty or contain any invalid characters.
7. Consider adding a logout mechanism. While this is not strictly necessary, it's a good practice to provide a way for users to log out of their accounts securely. This can be achieved by creating a `logout` function that sets the session cookie to an expired value and redirects the user to a login page.
8. Add comments to the code. While the code is well-structured, adding comments to explain what each function does will make it easier for other developers to understand the code and maintain it in the future.

Here's an example of how the suggestions could be implemented:
```python
import sqlite3
from hashlib import bcrypt

# Use a CSPRNG to generate random numbers for salt and password hashing
import random
random.seed()
salt = random.getrandbits(128)

def login(username, password):
    # Connect to the database using sqlite3
    connection = sqlite3.connect("users.db")

    # Use a secure hashing function for password storage
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt)

    # Query the database for the user with the given username and hashed password
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = {hashed_password}"
    cursor.execute(query)

    # Check if a user was found in the database
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    if user:
        print("Login successful")
    else:
        print("Login failed")

    connection.close()

def store_password(password):
    # Store the password as a hashed value using bcrypt
    salt = random.getrandbits(128)
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), salt)
    print(f"Storing hashed password: {hashed_password}")
```
